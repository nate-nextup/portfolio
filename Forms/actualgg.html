// Part 2: Create variable that holds the number of turns

// Create a variable for your "hint to the user" Ex: Guess my number between 1-20

// when is true != true?  What should our condition actually be?
while (true == true) {

// Use the prompt method to ask the user for input. Use this to also display the "hint to the user"
// Part 2: Also display how many tries the user has left

var guess = prompt(PUT YOUR HINT VARIABLE HERE);

// Convert the users guess to a number

// Use an if statement to see if the player's guess is equal to the random one generated


// Use an else statement to notify the user if they guessed incorrectly

// Part 2: Inside the else statement, tell the player whether their guess is too small or too big, Hint: you'll need to use an if statement

}

// Part 2: If the user runs out of guesses, tell them what the correct number is.  Hint: What variable did we use to define it?
