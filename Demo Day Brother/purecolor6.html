    <center><h1>About Me</h1></center>
    <br>
<p><h5>My name is Nathan Maurice Nicks Jr. and I am a 15 year old kid from the Bay Area where it could be super beautiful or super depressing depending on how you see the world and the decisions that you make. I like to play basketball and I love art(all types) but i've never been a great drawer or painter so i decided to do clothes and designing them. Also my parents have always told me to be my own boss/entrepreneur so that I could work whenever I want and so that my work isn't taken advantage of. My main goal of this big project in my life is to do something that I love and be able to make a living off of it. By making a living off it I don't just mean have to settle on not great things or me barely making it I want to be the best at it. Thanks for taking a look at my project, Have a great day.</h5></p>
